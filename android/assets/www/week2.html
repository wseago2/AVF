                            <h5>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</h5><br />

                            <p>First and foremost, you could run your html through an accessibility validator. Writing clean, compliant, semantic code will insure your app behaves properly with accessibility programs and devices.</p>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>

                            <h5>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</h5><br />

                            <p>While there were many general frustrations with the applications, the most
                            common comments that I found were related to poor layout, and poor form design, with inaccessible PDF documents running a close third.</p>

                            <p>To fix all of these frustrations, again it falls back to the design phase. Clean code, and the use of a validator would certainly eliminate these issues.

                            <h5>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility. </h5><br />

                            <p>All recent iOS devices have advanced accessibility functions built in, as well as the ability to extend the os with accessible friendly apps via the App Store.</p>

                            Apple includes assistive technology in its products as standard features — at no additional cost. For example, iPhone, iPad, iPod, and OS X include screen magnification and VoiceOver, a screen-access technology, for the blind and visually impaired. To assist those with cognitive and learning disabilities, every Mac includes an alternative, simplified user interface that rewards exploration and learning. And, for those who find it difficult to use a mouse, every Mac computer includes Mouse Keys, Slow Keys, and Sticky Keys, which adapt the computer to the user’s needs and capabilities.

                            <p>
                            Android devices benefit from similar features. It is also important to note that Google sponsors an eyes-free site, developer blog, and youtube channel.

                            <h5>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</h5><br />

                            <p>Unfortunately, my time is very limited, so I have to work with functionality taking priority over design and polish. In the real world, I believe that design outweighs functionality, especially in a world where apps tend to get more and more complex as time goes by. I think it is very important to remember that well designed simplicity will always be more desirable than all-encompassing mediocrity.</p><br />

                            <p>I am looking forward to getting hands-on with Phonegap. I believe it represents a valid way for people at my stage of the MDVBS program to actually begin to create viable applications. My ultimate goal for this project is to create an astronomy app that will help me in my hobby, as well as lay a foundation for many astronomy related apps and technologies in the future.</p><br />

                            <h5>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h5><br />

                            <p>In researching this question I came across a lot of applications that would benefit blind people that I never gave much thought to. My favorites were:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Money Reader (helps blind people identify bills).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Color Identifier (uses the iPhone camera to identify and speak color names aloud).
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <br />
                        </li>
