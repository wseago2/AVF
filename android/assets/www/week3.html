                            <h5>What are the “top selling” app categories in the United States?</h5><br />

                            <p>Games, entertainment media and education.</p><br />

                            <h5>What are the “top selling” app categories in Japan?</h5><br />

                            <p>Utilities, entertainment media and games.</p><br />

                            <h5>What are the “top selling” app categories in Great Britain?</h5><br />

                            <p>Games, navigation utilities and entertainment media</p><br />
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Based on the three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</h5><br />

                            <p>Games and entertainment media definitely rule mobile device use on a global scale. This trend is driven by users accessing devices during microbreaks, and by the increased availability of high speed access coupled with unlimited data.</p><br />
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                           <h5>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets?</h5><br />

                            <p>In the US, high speed data plans start at $30 per month for capped service. Unlimited plans start at $50 per month.</p><br />

                            <p>In the UK, lack of competition for high speed providers has resulted in capped service only. Rates begin as low as $12 monthly for 3G sim card service only, and $26 monthly for handset included service. Bandwidth limits are much more strict in the UK, with the average 4G connected service costing $61 per month, with a 20GB limit cap.</p><br />

                            <p>Japan has a public WiFi network that can be accessed for about $5 per month. The data is unlimited, but the coverage is spotty at best. Reliable ultra high speed service is available for about the same cost as in the US.</p>
                            <br />
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h5>How may this impact development?</h5><br />

                            <p>As developers, we need to always keep bandwidth usage in mind. Applications that consume extreme amounts of data will cause a consumer to discontinue using the app, no matter how well it fills a need.<p><br />
                         </li>
                     </ul>
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h5>What would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice?</h5><br />

                            <p>In light of the information gained from this research, I would have to say that a game app that would appeal to users during microbreaks would have the greatest chance to deliver a profit.</p><br />
