                <h5>Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</h5><br>

                <p>I think that establishing a secure authentication process would lead to companies like Twitter developing gateways to bridge into many other types of applications without the users having to log out of the gateway site or app. This would allow the monetization of countless possibilities, from shopping to access of goods, services or information, all while keeping the user logged into the site or app, which is the ultimate goal. Here is a very recent article discussing an early attempt:<p>

                <h5>Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</h5><br>

                <p>JSON data is a very universal, easy to use data exchange format, but it violates the Same Origin Policy. JSONP uses a callback function to get around this. This is why we need JSONP.</p><br>

                <h5>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</h5><br>

                <p>The bulk of the available JSONP APIâ€™s relate to social, education, calendars, shopping, mapping, photography and weather, with the most common definitely in the mapping and social categories. These would pair well with geolocation services, the camera, the compass, access to contacts and notifications, and connection information.</p><br>

                <h5>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</h5><br>

                <p>Unfortunately, my time is very limited, so I have to work with functionality taking priority over design and polish. In the real world, I believe that design outweighs functionality, especially in a world where apps tend to get more and more complex as time goes by. I think it is very important to remember that well designed simplicity will always be more desirable than all-encompassing mediocrity.</p><br>

                <p>I am looking forward to getting hands-on with Phonegap. I believe it represents a valid way for people at my stage of the MDVBS program to actually begin to create viable applications. My ultimate goal for this project is to create an astronomy app that will help me in my hobby, as well as lay a foundation for many astronomy related apps and technologies in the future.<p><br>

                <h5>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</h5><br>

                <p>Probably the biggest lesson I have learned is to try to spend as much time as possible in the planning stage of the application development cycle. Things tend to  go much smoother that way. I have begun putting together a large resource with as many time saving strategies as possible, such as templates, wireframes, button tutorials and the like. This week I spent way too much time on Responsive Web Design, but I made several grid templates that will save time in the future, and RWD is definitely here to stay.
